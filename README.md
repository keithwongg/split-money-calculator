# split-money-calculator
like a splitwise app - budget dumb down version without data persistence


todo:
- add logging for items - take from local storage
- finish up the who paid who structure
- think about datastructure for the calculation and tabulation logic | need to include the offsetting logic
- add import/export functionality - out to json and back into local storage

- add section to say: who should pay who and what is left for the total up balance.

- if delete people involved, all data related to the person will have to be removed.
 -> need to show pop-up notification + design that.

- might need to fix the id thingy

OWE - minus
PAY - plus

many to many r/s :
P1 - 2, 3, 4
P2 - 1, 3, 4
